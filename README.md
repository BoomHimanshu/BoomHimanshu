I am a 19-year-old and currently an UG student at K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering (Somaiya Vidyavihar University) in Mumbai and posted as the Joint Sports Secretary in the KJSCE Students' Council. I devote all my attention and focus to the task at hand and strive hard to finish it way before time and submit it punctually. I am totally loyal to the work assigned to me and the morals that I possess. I am extremely hard working which enables me to work in stressful conditions by taking it as an advantage to develop my decision-making capabilities and at the same time work calmly in these states. Additionally, I also work well with a team and adapt quite well to various conditions and people. I'm honest, optimistic, and flexible with my work, and also self-motivated which drives me to succeed towards my career and overall life. Also, I am an aspiring Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Analytics, Big Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing, Robotics, Deep Learning, Neural Networks fan and want to build my career in these sectors.
